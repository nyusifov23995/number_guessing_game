The computer generates a random number between 1 and 50.
The player inputs a guess.
The program gives feedback:
   - `"Too high"` if the guess is greater than the number.
   - `"Too low"` if the guess is less than the number.
If the player guesses correctly, the program congratulates them and tells which attempt they succeeded on (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).
If the player doesn't guess correctly in 5 attempts, the correct number is revealed and all the guesses are displayed.
